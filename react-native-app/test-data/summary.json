      "text": "The rise of AI-powered code assistants, like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, is transforming how developers write software. These tools not only boost productivity but also help developers debug, refactor, and innovate faster than ever before. Experts believe this shift could redefine coding for both beginners and professionals alike. By automating repetitive tasks and providing intelligent code suggestions, these assistants allow developers to focus more on problem-solving and creative solutions. Additionally, they act as on-demand mentors, offering instant explanations and examples to clarify complex concepts. As AI continues to evolve, its role in shaping the future of software development is expected to grow exponentially.",

      "text": "Sustainable architecture focuses on creating eco-friendly and energy-efficient buildings that minimize environmental impact. This design approach incorporates renewable energy sources, sustainable materials, and innovative techniques to reduce energy consumption and waste. From green roofs to solar panels, architects are increasingly adopting strategies to combat climate change and promote sustainability. A prime example is the Bosco Verticale in Milan, a residential building that features over 900 trees and thousands of plants, providing natural insulation and air purification. As climate concerns continue to grow, sustainable architecture is becoming a key focus for the construction industry.",
